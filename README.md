IGN-review-analysis
This project aims at a clear breakdown of the last 20 years of game reviews by IGN through data analysis, visualization, and observation of any patterns that may have appeared in the growing multi billion dollar gaming industry.


# Why?
Growing up, I was never able to pick up the recently released latest and greatest hit.  I owned an outdated console in the Gamecube at the time, but would still read reviews of new games despite never actually getting to play them.  I would sit and wonder to myself, "Will this amazing-looking new game actually be any good?  Is it worth the money someone is forking over?"
